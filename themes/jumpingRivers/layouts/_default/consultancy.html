					<h2>You</h2>
				</div>
				<div class="our-para">
					<p>The first part of any analysis is getting to know you. We will take the time to understand "stale" part of your process that is prohibiting progress. We will asses what improvements you can benefit from, be this greater efficiency, predictions, reporting visualisations or all of these. It is also important that a plan is set into action. We will prescribe a pathway to the most efficient approach to achieving your overall goal.</p>

					<h2>Capturing</h2>
				</div>
				<div class="our-para-2">
					<p>To get the best results from your data, it needs to be up to scratch. We will take an in-depth look at how you are recording your data and what you are recording. From there we can analyse whether it would be in your best interests to record more, less or different data. We will also assess how you can optimise the recording process.</p>

					<h2>Visualisation</h2>
				</div>
				<div class="our-para">
					<p>As humans, we find it easier to understand a picture than a collection of numbers. This is why visualising your data is the most important step to understanding your data. Trends and patterns are easier to spot through visualising. R and Python provide fantastic, intuitive and effortless packages such as **ggplot2** and **seaborn** for visualising data. Our consultants are experts in such packages.</p>

					<h2>Prediction</h2>
				</div>
				<div class="our-para-2">
					<p>It is hugely to important to understand the direction in which your business is heading. What will your data look like in an hours time? How will sales look in two months time? Predictions aren't just chained to sales either, examples include scheduling workforces, deliveries, testing times and new product development. With a combination of R and our experienced trainers, you will be able to build a strategic business plan backed by the accurate predictions built on your data by the latest machine learning techniques.</p>

					<h2>Reporting</h2>
				</div>
				<div class="our-para">
					<p>Reporting plays a crucial role in how your business utilises the results at hand. If results are poorly reported, it is easy for a business to misconstrue what they mean. R provides a seamlessly easy interface for producing reports and graphics from your data. Tired of making the same report every month? The automatic report feature will save you and your business countless hours.</p>

					<p>Having helped you through all of the above steps, it is crucial that we provide you with ongoing support to ensure your visualisations, predictions and reports are kept to the highest standard. This can be any method that suits you and your team, be this in person or online, whilst also being about any topic you would like to further enquire about. A lot of business' take this time with us to analyse their own code.</p>
